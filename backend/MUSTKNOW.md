Got it! Since you’re **entry-level aiming for a Full Stack / SDE role**, you don’t need to master all 120+ techniques immediately. Some are advanced, niche, or cutting-edge. Let’s **filter them for what’s essential for real-world, project-based work**. I’ll break it down by **category** and give a **recommended focus level**.

---

## **1. Performance & Optimization (10–12 core techniques)**

These are basic but essential for good UX and scalable apps.

- **Must know:**

  1. Pagination
  2. Lazy Loading / Infinite Scrolling
  3. Debouncing & Throttling
  4. Caching (client & server)
  5. Minification / Compression

- **Nice to know:** 6. Code Splitting (basic) 7. Prefetch / Preload 8. Image Optimization

**Focus:** Understand the concepts and implement in small projects.

---

## **2. Networking & API Management (8–10 core techniques)**

These are critical for building any full stack app.

- **Must know:**

  1. REST APIs (CRUD operations)
  2. Rate Limiting (basic concept)
  3. Debounced / throttled requests
  4. Fetch / Axios / HTTP clients

- **Nice to know:** 5. GraphQL basics 6. WebSockets (for chat / real-time apps) 7. API versioning

**Focus:** Build simple backend APIs and consume them from frontend.

---

## **3. State Management (5–6 core techniques)**

Essential for frontend logic and React/Vue/Angular projects.

- **Must know:**

  1. Client-side state (React state, context, or Redux basics)
  2. LocalStorage / SessionStorage
  3. Optimistic UI updates (simple example)

- **Nice to know:** 4. Server-side state (sessions, cookies) 5. Service Workers (basic PWA caching)

**Focus:** Build a project with dynamic UI and persistence.

---

## **4. Security & Access Control (6–7 core techniques)**

Important even in small projects to be “industry-ready.”

- **Must know:**

  1. Authentication & Authorization (JWT / sessions)
  2. Input validation
  3. HTTPS / basic TLS understanding

- **Nice to know:** 4. CSRF / XSS awareness 5. Role-based access (basic)

**Focus:** Implement login/auth in your project and validate input.

---

## **5. UX/UI & User Interaction (6–8 core techniques)**

You don’t need to be a designer, but good UX matters.

- **Must know:**

  1. Responsive Design (mobile-first)
  2. Form validation
  3. Skeleton Loaders / Loading Indicators

- **Nice to know:** 4. Progressive Web App basics 5. Accessibility basics (tab navigation, ARIA)

**Focus:** Build a project that works on desktop & mobile, with proper forms and loading indicators.

---

## **6. Development & Deployment Practices (5–6 core techniques)**

- **Must know:**

  1. Version control (Git)
  2. Environment variables / `.env` files
  3. Basic CI/CD concepts
  4. Unit testing basics (Jest / PyTest / Mocha)

- **Nice to know:** 5. Feature flags / toggles (optional)

**Focus:** Deploy one full stack project (Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify).

### ✅ **Summary for Entry-Level Full Stack / SDE**

| Category         | Must-Know Techniques                                               | Number |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Performance      | Pagination, Lazy Loading, Debounce/Throttle, Caching, Minification | 5      |
| Networking / API | REST APIs, Rate Limiting, Fetch / Axios, Debounce requests         | 4      |
| State Management | Client-side state, LocalStorage, Optimistic UI                     | 3      |
| Security         | Auth/Authorization, Input Validation, HTTPS                        | 3      |
| UX/UI            | Responsive Design, Form Validation, Loading Indicators             | 3      |
| Dev & Deployment | Git, Env variables, Unit Testing, Basic CI/CD                      | 4      |

**Total:** ~22 core techniques to **master first**.

The rest (GraphQL, WebSockets, SSR, Micro Frontends, advanced caching, observability, etc.) can be **learned gradually** as you work on more complex projects.
